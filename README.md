**HGEN-612 Course Description**  

This course builds upon the material introduced in the prerequisite (HGEN 611/OVPR 611) by providing instruction on advanced techniques for working with data and producing highly reproducible data products. The learning path focuses on the fundamentals of both machine learning and the creation of production ready web applications as two highly marketable skills for future data scientists. Project based assignments culminate in students creating their own applications that take advantage of tidymodel principles to automate machine learning workflows, visually communicate knowledge with interactive graphics, and the use of Git and OSF for project management. The guiding principle of the course is that the these products of research should be open and accessible to all members of a project team for maximum impact. This course will continue the use of the statistical programming language R with a focus on advanced tidyverse functions for data wrangling and statistical model development.
