## Hybrid Synochronous Instruction
HGEN 612 will primarily meet in-person. Please check the course schedule for meeting location (physical/remote). When remote lectures are indicated there should be no expectation that content will be recorded. The course modality is "hybrid synchronous" and there is an attendence requirement (see below).

### In-person
There are limited outlets in the VIPBG Conference Room so be sure to bring a fully charged laptop to each class. I am working on moving the course to the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor of the same building which will accommodate everyones' power needs (water damage has been reported in this room so we are kicked out for now).

### Remote
My preference is that students attend remote lectures with their cameras on. Ok, so I know this isn't going to happen but how about with your camera on for the frist 10 minutes?  


## A Note on Participation
Please note that regardless of lecture location your participation and attendance grade will not be assessed in the regular fashion. I am more interested that you are engaged with the class (e.g., during class and/or on Slack) and your assignments reflect attempts to innovate past what you were taught (i.e., coding creativity requires some degree of self-study). Lectures will likely not extend the entire time to avoid Zoom fatigue and we will strive to use our time in a way that we find is most beneficial for learning. All I ask is that you reach out to me to discuss your circumstances if your in-person or remote learning experience is faltering.  


## Course Description
This course builds upon the material introduced in the prerequisite (HGEN 611/OVPR 611) by providing instruction on advanced techniques for working with data and producing highly reproducible data products. The learning path focuses on the fundamentals of both machine learning and the creation of production ready web applications as two highly marketable skills for future data scientists. Project based assignments culminate in students creating their own applications that take advantage of tidymodel principles to automate machine learning workflows, visually communicate knowledge with interactive graphics, and the use of Git and OSF for project management. The guiding principle of the course is that the these products of research should be open and accessible to all members of a project team for maximum impact. This course will continue the use of the statistical programming language R with a focus on advanced tidyverse functions for data wrangling and statistical model development.  


## Prerequisite
HGEN/OVPR 611 Data Science 1 or Instructor permission.  


## Textbook
All required reading/viewing material will be linked to the lecture schedule located on the Github page. There is no required textbook. However, [*R for Data Science*][101] (Wickham & Grolemund) is an excellent general reference and [*Advanced R*][102] (Wickham) is great for a more in-depth guide to the R language.  


## Student Responsibilities
  - Bring your laptop to each class and be prepared to follow along with practical data examples.
  - Check `R/00_install-course-packages.R` before each class to install any new packages.
  - Complete assigned readings before the scheduled lecture date.  
  - Review and practice the code presented in the previous session.  
  - Please ask questions during class.
  - Ask for help whenever needed. Instructors will try to respond to messages within 24 hours. For best response times on, for instance, coding problems posting on the `#hgen-612` channel is recommended and allows others to benefit from your question. Students are encouraged to contribute answers.
  - Get used to finding answers to coding problems on stackoverflow.com and sharing them on `#hgen-612`.
  - Review and practice the code presented in the previous session. This is worth repeating.
  
  
## Communication Guidelines
  - Communicate with instructors privately using Direct Messaging within the class Slack workspace.  
  - Interact with fellow students and faculty members on the `#hgen-612` Slack channel.
  - Expect some emails generated by Canvas.
  - Be encouraging and helpful in all interactions. These are difficult concepts that take lots of practice to master. We all make mistakes. Patience and positive feedback is appreciated.


## Course Materials
We will be using OSF (https://osf.io/24mp7/) as the hub for all course materials in combination with Github. Both of these file management tools work nicely together and allow for users of different skill levels to access and interact with materials. This approach is commonly used in the wild and so we will adopt it in this course, in lieu of Canvas, to promote familiarity with this system. Details where each group of files live are as follows:  

  - Presentations and reading materials will be stored directly on OSF.
  - Code and course meta-information (e.g., syllabus) will be stored on the course Github site and linked to OSF.
  - Github has a steep learning curve and not everyone will become proficient users immediately - it takes a lot of practice. I will teach the basics so that everyone should be able to automagically access course materials. Otherwise, as previously stated, all materials will be accessible via the course OSF hub.
  - I do not plan on storing any materials on Canvas.
  - If a lecture is recorded it will be stored [here][103].  


## ReproducibiliTea
This is a journal club sponsored by the VCU Data Science Lab and VCU Libraries with the ambitious goal of fixing science (or at least to start a conversation about a few lingering issues). **Students are required to attend at least one meeting by 2023-04-30**. Be sure to read the journal article beforehand. And yes, tea will be provided (when we are in-person again). See schedule at https://osf.io/g56qp/wiki/Schedule.
